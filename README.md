# CNIT 133A - Javascript Libraries & Frameworks

This repository contains my projects submitted for CNIT 133A - Javascript Libraries & Frameworks, offered by the [Computer Networking & Information Technology](https://www.ccsf.edu/academics/ccsf-catalog/courses-by-department/computer-networking-and-information-technology) (CNIT) Department at [City College of San Francisco](https://www.ccsf.edu/) (CCSF).

Each project focuses on a different technology covered in the course. I will continue uploading them as they are submitted throughout the Fall 2024 semester.

This is intended to showcase my learning, and should not be used by students enrolled in the course.

## Topic 01: jQuery

This project was a review of the [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) library, which was introduced in a prerequisite course.

Clicking on the 'Light Mode' or 'Dark Mode' button triggers a jQuery event that changes the image, its alt text, and the text and background colors of the page.

The page also includes a section of text regarding [HTMX](https://htmx.org/). It answers a question about how to bind multiple event triggers to the same action. HTMX was briefly introduced at this point in the course, although it is not used in the code for this assignment.

This project was my first introduction to [D3](https://d3js.org/), a popular open-source library for visualizing data. The copy and design were created by me, and I did not use any styling libraries.

I used D3 to generate a bar chart from JSON data representing student enrollment numbers for several academic terms. I also used D3 to trigger a tooltip when a bar is moused over, showing the corresponding number of students above the bar.

## Topic 03: Typescript, Node & Deno

This module covered two technologies I was already very familiar with: [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en). It also introduced me to [Deno](https://deno.com/), a framework similar to Node and made by the same creator.

Since we were assigned written exercises in lieu of a project, you can see a sample of my work with Node in my [D&D Archivist](https://github.com/b-forster/dnd-archivist) repository (Warning: WIP!)


## Topic 04: Angular

<img width="500" alt="Screenshot of Angular project" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30e547b4-6bda-40ae-bd50-c71a334cb6e4">

This project was my first experience with [Angular](https://angular.dev/). The copy and design were created by me, and the logo was created with [icons8](https://icons8.com/icons).

For the assignment, I had to set up website for a farm selling snacks like nuts and dried fruit. It gave me a chance to practice generating components, routing, building a form with validations, and reading data from a JSON file.

I also learned how to deploy apps to the web using [Surge](https://surge.sh/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

There was a bit of a learning curve, but I didn't find Angular too difficult to pick up after my experience with React. I also enjoyed the predictability of the MVC architecture which I was familiar with from Ruby on Rails. I can see why Angular has been so popular with developers, and I would gladly work with it again.
